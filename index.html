            <p>Social Anxiety Disorder (social phobia) is the third largest mental health
               care problem in today's world.</p>
            <p>The latest government epidemiological data show social anxiety affects
               about 7% of the population at any given time. The chances of developing
               social anxiety disorder at any time during the lifespam stands slightly
               above 13%.</p>
        </article>
        <p class="title"><b>Definition</b></p>
        <p>Social anxiety is the fear of social situations that involve any kind of
           interaction with other people. You could say social anxiety is the fear
           and anxiety of being negatively judged an evaluated by other people.
           It is a pervasive disorder and causes anxiety and fear in most all areas
           of a person's life.  It is chronic because it does not go away on its own.
           Only direct cognitive-behavioral therapy can change the brain, and help
           people overcome social anxiety.
       </p>
        <p class="title"><b>Perceptions</p></b>
        <p>People with social anxiety are many times seen by others as being shy,
            quiet, backward, withdrawn, inhibited, unfriendly, nervous, aloof,
            and disinterested. Paradoxically, people with social anxiety want to make
            friends, be included in groups, and be involved and engaged in social
            interactions. But having social anxiety prevents people from being able
            to do the things they want to do. Although people with social anxiety want
            to be friendly, open, and sociable, it's fear (anxiety) that holds them back.
        </p>
        <p class="title"><b>Triggering Symptoms</p></b>
        <p>People with social anxiety usually experience significant distress in the
            following situations(this list is not a complete list of symptoms -- other symptoms may be
            associated with social anxiety as well):
            <ul>
                <li><em>Being introduced to other people</em></li>
                <li><em>Being teased or criticized</em></li>
                <li><em>Being the center of attention</em></li>
                <li><em>Being watched or observed while doing something</em></li>
                <li><em>Having to say something in a formal, public situation</em></li>
                <li><em>Meeting people in authority ("important people/authority figures")</em></li>
                <li><em>Feeling insecure and out of place in social situations ("I don't
                    know what to say.")</em></li>
                <li><em>Embarrassed easily (e.g., blushing, shaking)</em></li>
                <li><em>Meeting other peoples' eyes</em></li>
                <li><em>Swallowing, writing, talking, making phone calls if in public</em></li>
            </ul>

       </p>
       <p class="title"><b>Emotional Symptoms</b></p>
       <p>The feelings that accompany social anxiety include anxiety, high levels of
          fear, nervousness, automatic negative emotional cycles, racing heart, blushing,
          excessive sweating, dry throat and mouth, trembling, and muscle twitches. In
          severe situations, people can develop a dysmorphia concerning part of their
          body (usually the face) in which they perceive themselves irrationally and
          negatively. Constant, intense anxiety (fear) is the most common symptom.
       </p>

       <p class="title"><b>Insight</b></p>
       <p>People with social anxiety typically know that their anxiety is irrational, is
          not based on fact, and does not make rational sense.  Nevertheless, thoughts
          and feelings of anxiety persist and are chronic (i.e., show no signs of going
          away). Appropriate active, structured, cognitive-behavioral therapy is the only
          solution to this problem. Decades of research have concluded that this type of
          therapy is the only way to change the neural pathways in the brain permanently.
          This means that a permanent change is possible for everyone.
       </p>
       <p class="title"><b>Seeking Help</b></p>
       <p>Social anxiety, as well as the other anxiety disorders, can be successfully
          treated today. In seeking help for this problem, we recommend searching for a
          specialist -- someone who understands this problem well and knows how to treat
          it. Social anxiety treatment must include an active behavioral therapy group,
          where members can work on their "anxiety" hierarchies in the group, and later,
          in real-life situations with other group members. Social anxiety is a fully
          treatable condition (link is external) and can be overcome with effective
          therapy, work, and patience.
      </p>
      <p class="title"><b>Therapy (Treatment)</b></p>
      <p>Cognitive-behavioral therapy for social anxiety has been markedly successful.
         Thousands of research studies now indicate that, after the completion of social
         anxiety-specific CBT, people with social anxiety disorder are changed. They now
         live a life that is no longer controlled by fear and anxiety. Appropriate
         therapy is markedly successful in changing people's thoughts, beliefs, feelings,
         and behavior. The person with social anxiety disorder must be compliant and do
         what is necessary to overcome this disorder. National Institutes of Mental
         Health-funded studies report a very high success rate using cognitive therapy
         with a behavioral therapy group. Both are essential to alleviating anxiety
         symptoms associated with social anxiety disorder.
     </p>
      <p class="title"><b>Medication</b></p>
      <p>Social anxiety medication is useful for many, but not all, people with social
         anxiety disorder. For social anxiety, research indicates use of the anti-anxiety
         agents, and (perhaps) certain antidepressants in conjunction with CBT have proven
         most beneficial. Medication without the use of active, structured cognitive-
         behavioral therapy has no long-term benefits. Only CBT can change the neural
         pathway associations in the brain permanently. The therapy used must "fit" the
         way the human brain is structured. Current research indicates many antidepressant
         medications for social anxiety disorder to be useless, even in the short-term.
         About 15% of our in-person socially-anxious people are helped by antidepressants.
         Some of the large-scale medication studies for social anxiety have been questioned
         and found to be skewed in favor of the drugs marketed by the same pharmaceutical
         companies who paid for these studies to be done in the first place. These kind
         of studies are conflicts-of-interest, and their conclusions should be thoroughly
         questioned. In addition, each person is different, and there is no general rule
         that works concerning social anxiety and medications. For a typical person with
         social anxiety, who has an "average" amount of anxiety, along the quantifiable
         continuum, we have found an anti-anxiety agent to be most effective, if the
         person has no history of substance abuse. Antidepressants do not work anywhere
         near as well, in general. A typical superstititon, promoted by the drug companies,
         is that antidepressants have anti-anxiety properties. This is not true. If
         anything, many of the antidepressants make a person MORE anxious. However, not
         all people want or need medication. One of the big changes in the last decade is
         the gradual non-use of medications by people coming into active therapy for
         social anxiety. Nevertheless, it is the combination of cognitive and behavioral
         therapy that changes the brain and allows you to overcome social anxiety.
         Medications can only temporarily change brain chemistry and can be useful in
         some cases. This is very general advice, and you must consult with your
         psychiatrist when it comes to medications. Try to find someone who understands
         that anti-anxiety agents are not addictive to people with diagnosable anxiety
         disorders.
