        <article>
            <p>Social Anxiety Disorder (social phobia) is the third largest<br>
            mental health care problem in today's world.</p>
            <p> The latest government epidemiological data show social anxiety<br>
                affects about 7% of the population at any given time. The chances<br>
                of developing social anxiety disorder at any time during the lifespam<br>
                stands slightly above 13%.</p>
        </article>
        <p><b>Definition</b></p>
        <p>Social anxiety is the fear of social situations that involve any kind of<br>
           interaction with other people. You could say social anxiety is the fear <br>
           and anxiety of being negatively judged an evaluated by other people.<br>
           It is a pervasive disorder and causes anxiety and fear in most all areas <br>
           of a person's life.  It is chronic because it does not go away on its own.<br>
           Only direct cognitive-behavioral therapy can change the brain, and help<br>
           people overcome social anxiety.
       </p>
        <p><b>Perceptions</p></b>
        <p>People with social anxiety are many times seen by others as being shy, <br>
            quiet, backward, withdrawn, inhibited, unfriendly, nervous, aloof, <br>
            and disinterested. Paradoxically, people with social anxiety want to make <br>
            friends, be included in groups, and be involved and engaged in social <br>
            interactions. But having social anxiety prevents people from being able <br>
            to do the things they want to do. Although people with social anxiety want <br>
            to be friendly, open, and sociable, it's fear (anxiety) that holds them back.
        </p>
        <p><b>Triggering Symptoms</p></b>
        <p>People with social anxiety usually experience significant distress in the <br>
            following situations:
            <ul>
                <li>Being introduced to other people</li>
                <li>Being teased or criticized</li>
                <li>Being the center of attention</li>
                <li>Being watched or observed while doing something</li>
                <li>Having to say something in a formal, public situation</li>
                <li>Meeting people in authority ("important people/authority figures")</li>
                <li>Feeling insecure and out of place in social situations ("I don't <br>
                    know what to say.")</li>
                <li>Embarrassed easily (e.g., blushing, shaking)</li>
                <li>Meeting other peoples' eyes</li>
                <li>Swallowing, writing, talking, making phone calls if in public</li>
            </ul>
           This list is not a complete list of symptoms -- other symptoms may be <br>
           associated with social anxiety as well.
       </p>
       <p><b>Emotional Symptoms</b></p>
       <p>The feelings that accompany social anxiety include anxiety, high levels of<br>
          fear, nervousness, automatic negative emotional cycles, racing heart, blushing,<br>
          excessive sweating, dry throat and mouth, trembling, and muscle twitches. In <br>
          severe situations, people can develop a dysmorphia concerning part of their <br>
          body (usually the face) in which they perceive themselves irrationally and <br>
          negatively. Constant, intense anxiety (fear) is the most common symptom.
       </p>

       <p><b>Insight</b></p>
       <p>People with social anxiety typically know that their anxiety is irrational, is<br>
          not based on fact, and does not make rational sense.  Nevertheless, thoughts <br>
          and feelings of anxiety persist and are chronic (i.e., show no signs of going <br>
          away). Appropriate active, structured, cognitive-behavioral therapy is the only<br>
          solution to this problem. Decades of research have concluded that this type of <br>
          therapy is the only way to change the neural pathways in the brain permanently. <br>
          This means that a permanent change is possible for everyone.
       </p>
       <p><b>Seeking Help</b></p>
       <p>Social anxiety, as well as the other anxiety disorders, can be successfully <br>
          treated today. In seeking help for this problem, we recommend searching for a <br>
          specialist -- someone who understands this problem well and knows how to treat <br>
          it. Social anxiety treatment must include an active behavioral therapy group, <br>
          where members can work on their "anxiety" hierarchies in the group, and later,<br>
          in real-life situations with other group members. Social anxiety is a fully <br>
          treatable condition (link is external) and can be overcome with effective <br>
          therapy, work, and patience.
      </p>
      <p><b>Therapy (Treatment)</b></p>
      <p>Cognitive-behavioral therapy for social anxiety has been markedly successful.<br>
         Thousands of research studies now indicate that, after the completion of social<br>
         anxiety-specific CBT, people with social anxiety disorder are changed. They now <br>
         live a life that is no longer controlled by fear and anxiety. Appropriate <br>
         therapy is markedly successful in changing people's thoughts, beliefs, feelings,<br>
         and behavior. The person with social anxiety disorder must be compliant and do <br>
         what is necessary to overcome this disorder. National Institutes of Mental <br>
         Health-funded studies report a very high success rate using cognitive therapy <br>
         with a behavioral therapy group.  Both are essential to alleviating anxiety <br>
         symptoms associated with social anxiety disorder.
